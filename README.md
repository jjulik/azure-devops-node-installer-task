# azure-devops-node-installer-task
Node installer task for Azure Devops. This is a build agent task that installs node.js and npm. It should work with Azure Devops and TFS on-prem.

This project started as a fork of NodeToolV0 in https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks. The issue with NodeToolV0 is that it doesn't satisfy the npm dependency. This project also uses the newer azure-devops libraries.
